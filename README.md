## 1. Planning background

 How much do people worry during a day? Concerns always exist in our lives. If you worry too often, minor stress may occur, but it is difficult to tell someone about your daily worries. As a way to resolve concerns, it can be defined as follows. First, recognize what your worries are. Second, define concerns. Third, develop a solution. Studies have shown that people who take notes to solve problems are able to solve problems more accurately than people who do not. Based on this background, 'Can't we give opinions to solve problems and further help people solve their problems on their own?' We started planning this service with this question in mind.
